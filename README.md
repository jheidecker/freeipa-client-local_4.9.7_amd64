# freeipa-client-local_4.9.7_amd64
freeipa-client-local_4.9.7_amd64 for Debian bullseye

built from source here:

https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/freeipa/4.9.7/1.fc36.1/src/freeipa-4.9.7-1.fc36.1.src.rpm

usual: configure, make, make install
many libraries to install, and install locations were not as consistent as previous deb packages for freeipa-client
used https://debian.pkgs.org/10/debian-main-amd64/freeipa-client_4.7.2-3_amd64.deb.html as a reference package


This was tested on Debian 11.0 only!
